 * Each PLIC interrupt source can be assigned a priority 
 * by writing to its 32-bit memory-mapped priority 
 * register. The FU540-C000 supports 7 levels of 
 * priority. A priority value of 0 is reserved to mean 
 * "never interrupt" and effectively disables the 
 * interrupt. Priority 1 is the lowest active priority, 
 * and priority 7 is the highest. Ties between global 
 * interrupts of the same priority are broken by the 
 * Interrupt ID; interrupts with the lowest ID have the 
 * highest effective priority.

 * The FU540-C000 supports setting of an interrupt 
 * priority threshold via the threshold register. The 
 * threshold is a WARL field, where the FU540-C000 
 * supports a maximum threshold of 7. The FU540-C000 
 * masks all PLIC interrupts of a priority less than 
 * or equal to threshold. For example, a threshold 
 * value of zero permits all interrupts with non-zero 
 * priority, whereas a value of 7 masks all interrupts.
